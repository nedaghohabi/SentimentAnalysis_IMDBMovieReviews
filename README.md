## Introduction: 

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of movie reviews using the IMDb Large Movie Review Dataset, which consists of 50,000 reviews evenly split between positive and negative sentiments. We investigate a wide range of machine learning and deep learning approaches, including classical models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest with Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF), Fully Connected Networks and LSTMs with various word embeddings, and Transformer-based architectures such as DistilBERT and RoBERTa. Models were evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall, offering a comprehensive comparison across embedding strategies, fine-tuning techniques, and model complexities for sentiment classification.
